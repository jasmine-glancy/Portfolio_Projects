# Assignment 9: Disappearing Text App

The portfolio project for day 90 of [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code): A desktop app based on the [Most Dangerous Writing App](https://www.squibler.io/dangerous-writing-prompt-app)!

The goal was to greate a GUI with Tkinter that allows the user to type in a text box. If the user stops typing, after 3 seconds the color of the text changes. After 5 seconds, the user's text is wiped.
