# PET FOOD CALCULATOR

#### Video Demo: <[Pet Food Calculator](https://youtu.be/GNHv3KKURjY)>

#### Description:

Welcome to the Pet Food Calculator! This is a Flask web application that allows you to input your pet's information and get recommended feeding amounts. It will also provide specific recommendations based on your pet's life stage!

When changing your pet from one food to another, it is important to do a slow transition over 5-14 days (the actual time depends on how sensitive your pet's stomach is, though generally, the transition period is 5-7 days).

## Version 2 (completed 9/3/24)

### Treat Calculator

![a screen grab of the human food lookup page](static/assets/img/human_food_search_default.png)

The portfolio project for day 96 of [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code). The goal was to create a web application based on an API we found interesting. I chose the API from [FatSecret](https://platform.fatsecret.com/) because I wanted to to see the caloric information of various human foods. Using this information, the Pet Food Calculator calculates how much of a chosen human food they can receive per day without unbalancing their diet. Treat amounts are between 8-10% of a pet's resting energy requirements.

#### Choosing a Human Food

![a screen grab of the human food lookup page with search results](static/assets/img/human_food_search_results.png)

The user can choose the food that they want to calculate for by clicking the "Calculate Treat Amounts" button.

#### Final Treat Page Result

![a screen grab of the final treat calculation page](static/assets/img/human_food_calculation.png)

The final treat calculation page provides a reminder of the max amount of calories a pet can have per day from treats without unbalancing their diet. If there is more than a certain amount of a type of treat, users are cautioned to ensure with their vet that there will be no expected side effects or potential health issues.

### Future version goals

This was a project I had a lot of fun with, and I could work on it forever! This is version 2 of my final project, but I have the following goals for future versions:

- Food transition calculator
  - This would help users transition their pet from their current diet to another food by providing a table in the final report
  - This would calculate volumetric feeding amounts per each day (5-7 days for pets that don't have a sensitive stomach, or 10-14 days for pets that have a sensitive stomach)
  - There would be an additional route that asks for information for up to 2 new foods if the user is interested in transitioning their pet to a new food or if they are interested in feeding more than one diet
- Refactoring for speed and to reduce redundancy
- AI body condition scorer
  - Allow the user to upload several pictures of their pet (bird's eye, from the side, from the front) to attempt to determine the pet's body condition score
  - AI would view the pet's photos and return recommended body condition scores with the option to allow the user to override the recommendations
