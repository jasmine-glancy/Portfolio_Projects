# Assignment 6: Breakout Game

The portfolio project for day 87 of [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code): A replica of the late 70's game Breakout (and my personal favorite "retro" game) written in Python! A GUI is created with Turtle to display a paddle, a ball, a wall of breakable "bricks", and a scoreboard.

Created with the help of [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-breakout-game-using-python/) and [cs111 for the colors](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-breakout-game-using-python/)
