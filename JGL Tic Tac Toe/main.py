"""A text-based tic tac toe game!"""

# Two players, x and o

# There's a board with 9 boxes +/- nested array?

# TODO: Ask user to choose a symbol

# TODO: Ask user to place their sign in the available empty boxes

# TODO: Second player chooses a sign from an available empty box

# Goal is to place respective signs completely row-wise, column-wise, or diagonally

# TODO: Game continues until it ends in a draw or a win
    # It's a draw if all the boxes are filled without either player getting a winning match
